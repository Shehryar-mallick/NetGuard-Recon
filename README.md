# Pentesting

In my penetration testing project, I conducted a comprehensive security assessment aimed at identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities within a network infrastructure. Utilizing tools like Nmap, Wireshark, and Metasploit, I performed reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, and exploitation simulations on key systems to expose security weaknesses. I developed and executed tests covering network penetration, web application security, and social engineering, adhering to the OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities and ISO 27001 standards.

The project also included a detailed analysis of password policies, firewall configurations, and user permissions, ensuring compliance with industry best practices. As part of the assessment, I created custom payloads and exploits to simulate real-world attack scenarios, documenting all findings and delivering actionable recommendations. I provided mitigation strategies to strengthen system defenses, from patch management to enhanced user training programs.

This project honed my ability to identify security flaws, assess risks, and provide practical solutions, enabling stakeholders to improve their overall security posture and safeguard critical data against cyber threats.
