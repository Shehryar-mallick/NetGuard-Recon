# Description:
This project showcases a comprehensive penetration testing assessment on network infrastructure aimed at identifying vulnerabilities and enhancing security defenses. Utilizing tools such as Nmap, Wireshark, and Metasploit, I performed extensive reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, and exploitation simulations to uncover weaknesses within a simulated network environment. The tests included network penetration, web application security, and social engineering assessments, aligned with the OWASP Top Ten and ISO 27001 standards.

The project also included a detailed analysis of password policies, firewall configurations, and user permissions, ensuring compliance with industry best practices. As part of the assessment, I created custom payloads and exploits to simulate real-world attack scenarios, documenting all findings and delivering actionable recommendations. I provided mitigation strategies to strengthen system defenses, from patch management to enhanced user training programs.


## Key Project Highlights:

Vulnerability Analysis: Conducted in-depth scans and analysis on password policies, firewall configurations, and user permissions to ensure compliance with security best practices.
Custom Payloads & Exploits: Developed and implemented custom payloads to simulate real-world attack scenarios.
Security Recommendations: Documented all findings and delivered practical, actionable strategies to improve the security posture, covering patch management, firewall hardening, and user training.
Outcome:
This project strengthened my ability to identify, assess, and mitigate cybersecurity risks within a network infrastructure. The insights and recommendations provided enable stakeholders to implement improved security measures and enhance their overall defense against potential threats.
